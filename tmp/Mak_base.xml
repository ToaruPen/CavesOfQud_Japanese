        Why? A lifetime of vexation. Born to a cacophony of static ringing the ears raw. Thousands of my kinfolk cut down by that porphyric wasp fools called Lamb. A millenium of hot stinking sun and disgusting brine lice for supper.

        Misery obtains on this pond, whelp. By Chavvah if you start beaming like a sunray and yodeling at the Beetle Moon, I'll eat you where you stand.

        Have the adiyy chewed the hue from your eyes? See for yourself. Free folk make a gathering here and their racket rings through the reef. One can hardly steep in his greens without being mewled to by a salt-stung baby.
