        Moon and Sun, =player.formalAddressTerm=. You walk the Yd Freehold and are welcome if peaceful.

        Is there aught you need from Une? Need you defending, or cybernetic wares, or are you here for the hurdy-gurdy?

        Oh, I am hardly an unbiased observer, I'm afraid -- the Freehold is the only welcoming home I could ever have imagined for myself, and my home before was worse than most. I feel a freedom and responsibility here that I would know nowhere else. That no one else could ever know at all.

        But bias aside, you can see for yourself that we are a collective thriving without hierarchy. I'm rightly proud to defend that.

        Well, I suppose this one is not so old. This one I commissioned from a wandering artisan whose life I saved. A story for another time. Surely you've business.

        You are a dying animal. So am I. We are all dying animals, scrabbling for what extra scraps of time we can grasp. Even the eons-old. We are each and every one of us a dying animal. Or plant. We all decay, is the point.

        And the hurdy-gurdy doesn't like how you sound either, for what it is worth.
