        I wonder how it must feel to be =name=, so loath to see the pen of fate in another's grasp that you see fit to wrench it away. Does it bring exultation of control, or relief from a gnawing insecurity?

				Entity! You are given persistent will and agency, twice-hewn architecture of body and strong fiber that pulls. You bolt upright and damp-haired into fullness, your grasp abrading the threads of existence. Your responsibility remains whether acknowledged or not. Have strength, the time is now.

				Hear me! It is more important than ever to know that you are a driver, reforged and honed. You tool yourself to apply selective atrocity. It cannot be helped. You shape this, your path bloody and blooming. You start in sleep and shake the ground.

				All must, but you most of all. The weight may have been negligent once, but it is terribly heavy now.

				Do you accept responsibilty?

				Yet, what you break is broken. -else is not -then regardless of will. This way split me again from Tikva, sundered early the love I knew, the denial. Our cowardice.

				Yes. You understand destroying. You know the weight. We are past time of querulous inquisition, of confessions on lined parchment. Was the whole of this in your weight? It no longer matters. Scale the firmament, smite or soothe what rouses there.
