        I'm so excited.

        Many thanks for releasing Nacham, =factionaddress:Mopango=. I believe that its presence here will provide a great mutual boon.

        I am Doyoba, proud watcher of the children of the tomb. One child in particular. Of course =ifplayerplural:ye:thou= must comprehend, 'child' is but a fabricated epithet, as they are far older than we. The children are, that is.

        We mopango watch the past, each of us a different facet. My charge is named Nacham, that which watcheth and understandeth not, that which speaketh and cannot be understood. Information floweth through Nacham as water through a sieve, mixed together beyond ken.

        {{emote|*Doyoba's face scrunches in pain as ey communes with the device, before finally pushing it back into your grasp*}}

        By her light, that was unpleasant. How it twisted and turned, leading me to visions of Nacham's past, scraps and flashes. I can discern only glimpses of significance. Once a creator, an innovator. Can these parts of itself return intact, under the device's influence? An thou sendest void away, hast thou lost a part of thee?
