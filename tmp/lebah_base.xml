        Ah,

        aye.

        a most repulsive device. The mind-echoes of that communion yet haunteth me.

        Not... the device. Repulsive as a key to a prison doth repulse. To know a key is to know of a prison.

        Our watched children are bound, and lock swalloweth key. An =ifplayerplural:ye free:thou freest= one, three remaineth forever.

        k-Goninon hath it now. An =ifplayerplural:ye seek:thou seekest=.

        An elder ooze. My communion so disturbed me that I allowed them too close.

        k-Goninon consumed the device, but I escaped.
