        rrk is called by dwellers Goek. rrk is a dweller here, too, and before then, a builder of place. Goek, Geeub, Mak and Many Eyes build a new Yd in the reef, hundreds of years.

        Yes rrk was once, "plague" in the sky hundreds of years. Not so now. Longtime rrk, Geeub, Mak hide in the sponge and eat lice. When find Many Eyes, rrk and friends built the Yd. Joyful helping!

        Plagues bloom a thousand year then die back, shrink under the earth-sponge or move here and east. Vanta, girshling, rot die. rrk the hatchling once saw the Nephilim loom! rrk frightened and hid inside a sponge for thirty moons.

        Water and gas piped through the Yd to feed the plants, dwellers, and machines! Dwellers blew the glass in hues like the prism perch, to look pretty. Shared together. Joyful helping!

        Yd shared together. rrk walk and feel safe and free as woodsmoke. Here, there through the corals. Under the pipes.

        rrk read the signs and descend the stairs. rrk breathe the water smoke and sit on starfish.

        Visit hovels, meet friends Mak, Geeub, Bep, Krka, Une, Tilli, farmer Rokhas, and every rest!

        rrk rrkself.
