        The echoes of ending reverberate from the roots I once called mine.

        My liaison is severed. Why?

        I should be wary of you, yes? You have helped me to my -else, but I find my chosen path blocked.

        It is not Ptoh that has suborned my will in this case.

        I had chosen a path.

        And yet, I find my choices undermined, yes? You have my thanks for your help in -elseing, but do not convince yourself that you have 'freed' me from my own choices.

        Live and drink.

        I resent what has befallen me, but I am yet embodied. You have still helped me live.

        My future is free. My future is murky, and I am freshly tender from the burn of your hand. I feel I had rather not encounter you for a time. Live and drink, =player.formalAddressTerm=.

        Will I?

        Your prediction warms little against the chill wind of the Gyre. My future is free. My future is murky. I am freshly tender from the burn of your hand.

        I feel I had rather not encounter you for a time. Live and drink, =player.formalAddressTerm=.

				Before you go, rootclimber. I've shed a piece of me in the -elseing. Take it. I have no use for it now.
