				O! O! A new life obtains? You musn't shudder at old Death!~
				When an eremite consults the teraphim and sees the eyes of Death, only the fools frets! There is Change but no Ending.~
				A plague is what burns the core out and lets the berries grow.~
				O Nephilim! Come for our star bath??~
				I want salt in my mouth, dead eyes in radiating darkness, and a frog for a friend.~
				O Life, O Change! Embrace us, entangle us...~
				The Fishhead will catalyze the electric lake, and sure we as fossils will brick the ground but what a dais it will be!~
				The electric sizzle of life! Prickling and crisping skin, red and raw and beautiful beneath.~
				Eaten by the air. Death by life. O Rermadon!~
				Live mites in the burning gas will appear green to the Future.
