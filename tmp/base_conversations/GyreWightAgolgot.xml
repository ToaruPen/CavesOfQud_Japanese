				O! O! A new life obtains? You musn't shudder at old Death!~
				When an eremite consults the teraphim and sees the eyes of Death, only the fools frets! There is Change but no Ending.~
				A plague is what burns the core out and lets the berries grow.~
				O Nephilim! Come for our star bath??~
				I want salt in my mouth, dead eyes in radiating darkness, and a frog for a friend.~
				O Life, O Change! Embrace us, entangle us...~
				I can lick the flanges free of their pipe milk and hear my tongue fizzle in foam!~
				Girsh Agolgot! Red dusts in my nails and burning hot bubbles swell in my glands! Now I point to the future.~
				The world stews and titrates.
				O, the thrill of coursing Change within. Each pump of the heart drives it deeper. Each breath a breath of new life.~
				Roil with me, and bubble over. Let us exceed ourselves!
