				O! O! A new life obtains? You musn't shudder at old Death!~
				When an eremite consults the teraphim and sees the eyes of Death, only the fools frets! There is Change but no Ending.~
				A plague is what burns the core out and lets the berries grow.~
				O Nephilim! Come for our star bath??~
				I want salt in my mouth, dead eyes in radiating darkness, and a frog for a friend.~
				O Life, O Change! Embrace us, entangle us...~
				Bore ribbons in the chrome like wild ants and see a cross-section of human and shell!~
				I dream of a crawl nook on a nether stratum where I out-sweat the burning Gyre, and then peek an eye across a new horizon.~
				Thirteen years in the ground. Seventeen years in the ground. A thousand years in the ground!
