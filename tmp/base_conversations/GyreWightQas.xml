				O! O! A new life obtains? You musn't shudder at old Death!~
				When an eremite consults the teraphim and sees the eyes of Death, only the fools frets! There is Change but no Ending.~
				A plague is what burns the core out and lets the berries grow.~
				O Nephilim! Come for our star bath??~
				I want salt in my mouth, dead eyes in radiating darkness, and a frog for a friend.~
				O Life, O Change! Embrace us, entangle us...~
				The bell sounds wheel at right angles and shock the wet meat off our perfect bones! I was made to be bones.~
				The moon is their marriage light! And then a whole world for the Girsh daughters of nephilim!~
				Reach out and touch the heart. Our bonds transcend distance!~
				Push out the walls of the new world, Qas, to be its center!
