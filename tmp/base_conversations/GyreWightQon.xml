				O! O! A new life obtains? You musn't shudder at old Death!~
				When an eremite consults the teraphim and sees the eyes of Death, only the fools frets! There is Change but no Ending.~
				A plague is what burns the core out and lets the berries grow.~
				O Nephilim! Come for our star bath??~
				I want salt in my mouth, dead eyes in radiating darkness, and a frog for a friend.~
				O Life, O Change! Embrace us, entangle us...~
				Primrose and witchwood will boil the boundaries of sense into death-pleasure!~
				The Grounded Mind cannot soar. The Mind Aloft is limitless.~
				Be open. Receive the Greatest Dreams. Hear the Girsh Sing.~
				You can be it. We can all be it! Behold Nephilim!
