				O! O! A new life obtains? You musn't shudder at old Death!~
				When an eremite consults the teraphim and sees the eyes of Death, only the fools frets! There is Change but no Ending.~
				A plague is what burns the core out and lets the berries grow.~
				O Nephilim! Come for our star bath??~
				I want salt in my mouth, dead eyes in radiating darkness, and a frog for a friend.~
				O Life, O Change! Embrace us, entangle us...~
				Do you wish for a gleaming bath, and fractal veins that pump the continuity of life?~
				You've a twin across the boundary of the future, where new life blooms in rot. Are you with them?~
				Would you kill your double? Would you let it kill you?~
				It is to witness the scalpel parting tissue. The beauty of division and resection.
