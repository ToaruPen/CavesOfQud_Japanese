      <text>Welcome to the village of *villageName*, =spice.commonPhrases.adventurer.!random=</text>

    <node ID="SlynthRequest">Is that so? I imagine you are wondering whether =village.name= will host these slynth, to partake in =village.activity= alongside us.</node>
    <node ID="SlynthRequestAccept">
      <text>You have done much for =village.name=, =name=, and your request befits your stature. If these slynth will join us in =village.activity= and if they can come to cherish =village.sacred= as we do, then they are welcome here.</text>
      <choice Target="End">You have my thanks, friend.</choice>
    </node>
    <node ID="SlynthRequestReject">We have not come so far from the founding of =village.name= to allow these strangers in. What if they worship =village.profane=? No, we simply cannot do such a great favor for you.</node>
    <node ID="SlynthAbout">Do you have news of the slynth?</node>
    <node ID="SlynthArrived">
      <text>
        Ah, =name=, the slynth are here, and it is a slow process for these plant-folk and the people of =village.name= to grow accustomed to one another. By the goodness of =village.sacred= may the slynth find their place here soon.

      <text>
        Praise =village.sacred=, the slynth learn our ways and we theirs. Some do not wholly accept the depravity of =village.profane=, but their ways are born of kindness, and so =village.name= will be kind in kind.
