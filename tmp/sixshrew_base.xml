        I am Sixshrew, a merchant from the Consortium of Phyta disinclined to waste xyr time on talkative strangers.

        I sell things, and you can buy them. I would in fact strongly encourage you to buy them, or be on your way.

        You're being a bit annoying, so I suppose both of us have our burdens to bear.

        Perhaps we should do some trading and move on with our lives, hmm?

        Oh, I'm fine, fine.

        I simply adore being assigned this stinking backwater musa grove after decades of service, unceremoniously dumped in an office next to a fleshy tinker who works day and night, making all manner of racket through the thinnest, most conductive walls ever crafted.

        What is it humans say? "Living the dreen?" Yes, I am living the dreen.
