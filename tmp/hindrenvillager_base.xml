        What now? Nothing like this has ever happened before.~
        It's difficult to return to normal life after such an upheaval.~
        Forgive me, kendren, but the sight of you makes my hands quake.~
        Oh? Is it really over? I'm afraid.

        I will admit, Hindriarch Esk leads well.~
        Can we really trust such a young Hindriarch?~
        I am both afraid and hopeful for our future. But perhaps this is what we need.~
        Oh, it is you. Thank you for helping the village.

        Live and drink, kendren. I am very busy.~

        Ah... uhm. I... you, ah.~
