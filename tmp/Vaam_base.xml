Behind the hissing of those feet on the ground is the strains of a faint voice, someone speaking from inside a distant cave. Audible, but not understandable.*}}

        {{emote|*You offer the repulsive device. As it nears the shining, dark surface of Va'am's thick carapace, a sudden fervor seizes the device, and it twists itself free, latching onto the entity with the hooked teeth of its mouthlike appendage. Va'am shudders with such violence that its plates rattle against one another, and the light behind its faceplate dims.*}}

        {{emote|*For a time, it is still, its eye dark. Then a quiet but clear voice vibrates through the armored body:*}}

        Ah.

        Yes. I thank =ifplayerplural:ye:thee=.

        =ifplayerplural:Ye have:Thou hast= freed me from a deep stupor. Once I was a protector, before being sentenced to protect nothing and no one.

        I remember little of that time.

        I have yet to find my purpose. I can think and speak, and so this shell is nearly comfortable.

        One piece, however, doth yet chafe me. =ifplayerplural:Would ye:Wouldst thou= take it? Perhaps =ifplayerplural:ye can:thou canst= grant it some use.
