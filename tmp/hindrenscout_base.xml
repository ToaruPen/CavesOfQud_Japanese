        I've a bad feeling about all this.~
        The threat is not over. Mark my words.~
        We're not safe yet. I can feel it.~
        This resolution is not to my liking...

        I remain wary, but there is no question that Bey Lah thrives, even with open borders.~
        Live and drink.~
        Live and drink, kendren.~
        Oh, it is you. Stay safe.

        I am uncomfortable with change, but it is a skill to train like any other.~
        Live and drink.~
        Live and drink, kendren.~
        I hope Hindriarch Esk can keep us safe.

        Live and drink, kendren.~
        I will do my best to be civil with you, kendren, but we hindren are bred into wariness.~
        Cause no trouble here, kendren.~
        Be kind, kendren. We are watching you.~
        Why do you remain here? Please, finish your business.~
        It feels strange to allow you to cross our borders unimpeded, but Grand-Doe wills it.~
        No good can come of allowing kendren into Bey Lah...
