        I have volunteered to monitor an ancient machine-creature called Kah. Perhaps =ifplayerplural:ye have:thou hast= seen it, skipping hither and yon on strange limbs.

        Often I wonder if Kah knoweth aught else but fear.

        Oh dear.

        This is the credo by which I live my life, and =ifplayerplural:ye ask:thou asketh= "what does that mean?"

        I cannot summarize such a thing for =ifplayerplural:ye:thee=. It is too great, too multifaceted.

        {{emote|*Gyamyo moves little during communion, but shivers and twitches from time to time. After a minute or so, ey returns the device to you.*}}

        I am shaken. No doubt my journey wast shallow compared to Lebah's dive. But now, by my troth I say: Kah hath ever been a being of motion. Swift, kinetic, and elegant. No doubt 'twould be so if freed by yon device.
