        I must admit, =name=, that I can think of few notions more challenging to my people than to welcome a flower-people into our town. Some will see them as no better than walking lah.

        But if the notion came from you, they might consider putting it to a vote, at least. If you'll stand by, I will call a referendum.

        The question isn't why I left, it's why I'm the only one who chose to do so, why none of my pleas were convincing to the hindren I love. If we would just open the borders, it would never have come to this.

        The Hindriarch is the most likely suspect, in my opinion. She might have kept it for herself or sold it. I've been suspicious of her pet bodyguard, Kesehind, for years--I wouldn't put it past him to steal the treasure himself.

        That said, it might have been an outsider like you. I doubt any of the villagers had the nerve to steal such a valuable object, but I suppose it's faintly possible.

        But it wasn't Neelahind. You won't find a purer heart in all of Qud than hers.

        Objects out of place, certainly. Bey Lah produces little and sees almost no violence, so signs of the outside world should be easy to find.

        By majority vote, the slynth are welcome to take up permanent residence here in Bey Lah! I didn't think we were ready, but I suppose my people showed me otherwise. 
        
        They will effectively be apprentices to the village until they choose a vocation. If they choose to come here, that is to say.

      I am afeared to even mention this notion to the villagers. Can you imagine my epitaph?
      
      "Here lies the youngest Hindriarch in Bey Lah's history, trampled to death because she suggested we invite in a people most readily described as 'lah with legs'."
      
      If they trusted you more, maybe we could put it to a vote. But as it is? No. Sorry, =name=.

        Never greater has been my desire to be voted out of office.

        Oh, not because of the slynth! Well, yes, because of the slynth, but it's because I'd rather be out there with them – scouting, guarding, even tending to lah would be better than all this dry supervisory work.

        Room, board, assignments... it never occurred to me that immigration would require such intensive logistics.

        At long last I bear a lighter load of work coordinating our new family members. I won't claim that all of my people are fully comfortable with the slynth, but the faundren love them.

        Why can't you just shoot me like the other kendren? Those wounds heal better, and death would be preferable to what you have done to me.

        Go sit on a tumbling pod. I've had enough of you.

        Oh, so you have! Amazing work, kendren. We owe you more than we can give, but here is what we can give nonetheless.

        You are more than welcome here in Bey Lah any time.

        Extremely frustrating! But I am yet hopeful.

        My people are resistant to change, but they don't seem opposed to the idea of a Democracy. I need to give them a measure of time before we hold an election, but they'll ultimately agree as long as I am acting Hindriarch.

        Then, fates willing, they will vote me out. I'll be voting for Isahind, myself. Once I convince her to run.
