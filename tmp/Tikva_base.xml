        The light shines so bright, the voidshadow folds not upon it. It exults. It relaxes. It wills this troubled feeling away.

        Thank you for clearing Tau's path, =name=. This is better.

        It wills this troubled feeling away. It looks to the light with something in its eyes. It tries to blink the something away, but it cannot. The light is dim through the something in its eyes.

        But the light yet shines. It will blink and it will see the light in searing glory. I thank you, I thank you, I thank you.

      It is called Tikva, low and humble. The chime rests in a web of strong love, a little piece of something greater and so much more beautiful. As are you, but a gestalt unto yourself. A world to be orbited.</text>

        It channels the breathtaking things seen and heard and known. Bathe your senses in it until they grow accustomed. You will see nothing else.

        It... can scarce find the dream in this light. It thinks of Tzedech and weeps. It was not here, last time the static was in high pitch, but it remembers the pain and fear. It is not ready to feel these, it cannot. Gaze into its light and speak not of nightmares.

        It begs. Speak not of Tau. She shone so bright, with none of the heat from my -- from Tzedech.
        
        To remember her departure harms it. This and gyredream are too much for it to bear.

      No, it cannot, it cannot, it cannot. It misses it, it misses it, it misses it, it cannot it cannot it cannot.
      
      Look into the light. It burns away the sorrow, it burns away. Please, please, please.</text>
