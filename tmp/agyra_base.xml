        If Nacham is as wise as Doyoba believes, we stand to learn much very soon. Perhaps our coterie will spread the knowledge we gain, and we become a step closer to the Kasaphescence.

        I cannot help but hold some fear toward Dagasha. However, an it means us no harm I am open to allying with it. No doubt the future of this coterie hath changed, mayhap for the better.

        That said, I am uncertain what changes to expect. Dost the ancient Va'am yet have the capacity to defend, or protect? Can we gift it with a better means for transportation? I'll speak to Dadogom of this, and time shall reveal all.

        I find myself amused at Kah's 'rest', for it appeareth as active as ever--far more so than I, ever. But running free and running unwillingly are certainly not the same. Perhaps, in time, it can learn a deeper rest from us.
